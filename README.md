# Studying with debug
I can't debug successfully. But , I also don't know what went wrong.   

When I have enough experience, I will try to revise.

**What did I learn?**    
&emsp;&emsp;I should need a `tool` to develop a flowchart before I write a `coding scheme`.  
&emsp;&emsp;I don't consider logic in code as a diffculty ,and I rarely fail in logic when I write a code in reality. But, I usually failed in a tiny thing what is spelling mistake or using other variable . I have correct logic in my mind , but my hand or my `muscle memory` give the code a fatal error. It's afflictive !  
&emsp;&emsp;So I think that I need a coding scheme to help me to check code to resisting the bad effects of muscle memory.   
&emsp;&emsp;I will use `Visio` to do this. And I hope I can find better tool.

## ./CT/Split_Bregman 2022/5/19
&emsp;&emsp;The program took me a week. On roads to coding-success, it's afflictive üòü On roads to success in the experiment which gived me good results, it breaks my faith üò≥. Through this exprience, I have learned a lot. Then, I will record my thoughts.  
**What did I learn?**  
* ___`Functional Programming`/`Structuerd Programming(SP)` is the better programming paradigm than `Procedural Programming`.___<br>
&emsp;&emsp;Some time before that, I don't like Functional Programming. Because I think Procedural Pragramming makes me feel comfortable when I write a code, and Functional Programming needs too many parameters to write into Function particularly when you need nested function calls.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;However, It's a miserable thing that review a code using Procedural Pragramming and having over 509 lines. When I debug a code using Functional Pragramming, the review is so easy.**By using Functional Pragramming, the work of review is clear: check the Spelling mistake and logic error in this function; check the parameters about both type and definition; check the value of return results. Through focusing on these points, you can review your code clearly and fastly.** I was impressed (smiling_face_with_tear).  
* ___‚ÄúEasy to read, review, and extend‚Äù is the key to write a good code. If you not need to consider high-performance , many techniques aren't important!___
