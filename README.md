# Studying with debug
I can't debug successfully. But , I also don't know what went wrong.   

When I have enough experience, I will try to revise.

# Failed to debug

# Success to debug
## ./CUDA/matrix_multiplication.cu  
**What did I learn?**    
&emsp;&emsp;I should need a `tool` to develop a flowchart before I write a `coding scheme`.  
&emsp;&emsp;I don't consider logic in code as a diffculty ,and I rarely fail in logic when I write a code in reality. But, I usually failed in a tiny thing what is spelling mistake or using other variable . I have correct logic in my mind , but my hand or my `muscle memory` give the code a fatal error. It's afflictive !  
&emsp;&emsp;So I think that I need a coding scheme to help me to check code to resisting the bad effects of muscle memory.   
&emsp;&emsp;I will use `Visio` to do this. And I hope I can find better tool.
## ./CT/Split_Bregman
&emsp;&emsp;The program took me a week. On roads to coding-success, it's afflictive ðŸ˜Ÿ On roads to success in the experiment which gived me good results, it breaks my faith ðŸ˜³. Through this exprience, I have learned a lot. Then, I will record my thoughts.
